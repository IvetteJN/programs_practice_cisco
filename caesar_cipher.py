'''
This cipher was (probably) invented and used by Gaius Julius Caesar and his troops during the Gallic Wars. 
The idea is rather simple â€“ every letter of the message is replaced by its nearest consequent (A becomes B, B becomes C, and so on). 
The only exception is Z, which becomes A.
*it accepts Latin letters only (note: the Romans didn't use whitespaces or digits)
*all letters of the message are in upper case (note: the Romans knew only capitals)

#prepare a string for an encrypted message (empty for now)

    #if the current character is not alphabetic
    if not char.isalpha():
        #ignore it
        continue
    #convert the letter to upper-case (it's preferable to do it blindly, rather than check whether it's needed or not)
    char = char.upper()
    #get the code of the letter and increment it by one;
    code = ord(char) + 1
    #if the resulting code has "left" the Latin alphabet (if it's greater than the Z code)

'''Improving the Caesar's Cipher:
Your task is to write a program which:

*asks the user for one line of text to encrypt;
*asks the user for a shift value (an integer number from the range 1..25 - note: you should force 
the user to enter a valid shift value (don't give up and don't let bad data fool you!)
*prints out the encoded text.
